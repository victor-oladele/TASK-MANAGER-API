After many series of nodejs(express) and mongodb classes i have decided to build a simple task manager API.

This is a simple task manager API where the enduser can create , get-all(read) , update , get-single(read) , and delete task . Where the task is set to false by default after been created and then the user can update the task to true once the task is completed
